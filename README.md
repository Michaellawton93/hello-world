# Tricalc
A program in Python which performs calculations relating to triangles.

At the start of the program the user is presented with a main menu. The main menu gives four options - 1, 2, 3 and q. Option 1 allows the user to find the missing angle of a triangle, option 2 allows the user to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, option 3 allows the user to find the area of a right-angle triangle and q quits the program. 

After each calculation the user is directed back to the main menu. The user is not directed back to the main menu if q is pressed - in this case the program quits.
